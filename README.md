# exercise-project
This repository contains several small Python programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, including arithmetic operations, user input handling, conditional statements, loops, and functions.

Programs Included
1. Arithmetic Calculations
Performs basic mathematical operations: addition, multiplication, and exponentiation.
Example result: 149769.

2. Password Generator
Takes user input: name, year of birth, and age.
Generates a password using:
Last two digits of the birth year.
First three letters of the name.
The square of the age.
Example output: 95Joh676 for John (born in 1995, age 26).

3. Even or Odd Number Checker
Takes two numbers as input.
Determines whether both, one, or none are even.

4. Sum of Numbers
Takes an integer input.
Computes the sum of numbers from 0 to num - 1.
Example: If the input is 5, the sum is 10.

5. Number Guessing Game
Two-player game where each player guesses a randomly generated number between 0 and 10.
Tracks the number of attempts for each player.
Declares the winner based on fewer attempts.

Technologies Used:
Python 3
random module for number generation
